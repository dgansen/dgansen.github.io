* The high temp and low temp models did not apply importance to the same features. The non-temperature features that low temp model looked at most were station slope, elevation (DEM), and latitude. Meanwhile, the high temp model looked to the next day's predictions for humidity (LDAPS_RHmin), for early cloud cover (LDAPS_CC1), and for average latent heat flux (LDAPS_LH).*
