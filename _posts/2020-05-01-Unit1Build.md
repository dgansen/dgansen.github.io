## How Do Individual Countries Perform in the Cup of Excellence Competition?

  The [Alliance for Coffee Excellence](www.https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/cup-of-excellence/) puts on a competition/auction in select countries around the globe with the intention of giving small, high-quality coffee farmers a stage to present their hard work. The format of the Cup of Excellence (COE) is a series of cupping rounds tasted by increasingly well-trained National, then International judges. The top 30 coffees scoring above a threshold get to be presented for auction to the worldwide community of coffee roasters and distributors scouring the world for the untapped high-quality lots.

*[Scoring](https://github.com/dgansen/dgansen.github.io/raw/master/img/cupping_form_new-3.pdf) is an aggregate of qualities like aroma, sweetness, acidity, and mouthfeel and undergoes a massive amount of testing.*

The proliferation of the specialty  coffee industry over the past decade has been driven by organizations like these, working to bring naturally better tasting coffee to a growing consumer base and ensuring farmers don't suffer from the notoriously low prices the industry faces. **Dedication to quality on the production side is risky**, requiring an environment with rich biodiversity, skilled labor to pick cherries at the exact ripeness, washing/fermentation that enhances good flavors and doesn't introduce bad ones, and all at the sacrifice of yield quantity. 

Fortunately, the recognition these farmers have been receiving has steadily been driving upward, which pushes prices up, and competition for quality in turn as other farmers make their operations more attentive.

### Diving in to the data
Out of nearly 4000 lots showcased at competitions over the last 20 years that made it into the top 30 for auctioning, I've collected them all to see what the data tells us. 
#### Average bid prices have steadily gone up, and farmers are less worried about getting their payday, opting for quality over quantity

At auctions like these, prices that the roasters will pay can reach astounding peaks, with Don Cayito's Honey Gesha netting just over $300/lb at the Costa Rica 2018 event. Results like this spread word far and wide, encouraging wider involvement, pushing the boundaries of expected quality further and further.

As these coffees are only up for competition within their countries, a curiosity struck me:
####  Which country's coffee is best, overall?

![violin graph](/img/violin.png)
The violin plot above shows the distribution of scores each country's top 30 has accumulated over the years, and the width is matched to the bars below showing how much coffee has been cumulatively sold. Most of the countries behave similarly, with the majority of the auctioned coffees scoring just above the threshold to make it to this round. What should be pointed out is that Brazil is an absolute juggernaut of coffee production, so much so that COE split its Brazilian events by processing method ("Naturals," and "Pulped Naturals") until two years ago.   
**What can answer the posed question, however, is looking at where the violins are widest**. They almost all fall in the 86-87 score range, but Mexico and Peru shift their medians up to about 87.5, perhaps aided by smaller sample size. Colombia, Honduras, Burundi, and Nicaragua all stretch their distributions into a piece of the low 90's.

_It should be noted that two of the world's leading countries in coffee production, Ethiopia and Kenya, have never held COE events (Ethiopia's first is coming August 2020) due to a variety of reasons, possibily among them governmental restriction over non-governmental organizations facilitating sales._

This will be a continuing project as I am yet wanting to answer further questions like:
* Which regions reliably perform the best? What are their characteristics?
* Which varietals and processing methods have proliferated the most, and why?
* Is this competition representative of the global, non-specialty coffee trading patterns?
