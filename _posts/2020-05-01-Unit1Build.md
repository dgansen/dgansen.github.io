## How Do Individual Countries Perform in the Cup of Excellence Competition?

  The [Alliance for Coffee Excellence](www.https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/cup-of-excellence/) puts on a competition/auction in select countries around the globe with the intention of giving small, high-quality coffee farmers a stage to present their hard work. The format of the competition is a series of cupping rounds tasted by increasingly well-trained National, then International judges. The top 30 coffees scoring above a threshold get to be presented for auction to the worldwide community of coffee roasters and distributors scouring the world for the untapped high-quality lots.  

[Scoring](https://github.com/dgansen/dgansen.github.io/raw/master/img/cupping_form_new-3.pdf) is an aggregate of qualities like aroma, sweetness, acidity, and mouthfeel and undergoes a massive amount of testing
