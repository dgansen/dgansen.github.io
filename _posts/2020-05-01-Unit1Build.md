## How Do Individual Countries Perform in the Cup of Excellence Competition?

  The [Alliance for Coffee Excellence](www.https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/cup-of-excellence/) puts on a competition/auction in select countries around the globe with the intention of giving small, high-quality coffee farmers a stage to present their hard work. The format of the Cup of Excellence (COE) is a series of cupping rounds tasted by increasingly well-trained National, then International judges. The top 30 coffees scoring above a threshold get to be presented for auction to the worldwide community of coffee roasters and distributors scouring the world for the untapped high-quality lots.

*[Scoring](https://github.com/dgansen/dgansen.github.io/raw/master/img/cupping_form_new-3.pdf) is an aggregate of qualities like aroma, sweetness, acidity, and mouthfeel and undergoes a massive amount of testing.*

The proliferation of the specialty  coffee industry over the past decade has been driven by organizations like these, working to bring naturally better tasting coffee to a growing consumer base and ensuring farmers don't suffer from the notoriously low prices the industry faces. **Dedication to quality on the production side is risky**, requiring an environment with rich biodiversity, skilled labor to pick cherries at the exact ripeness, washing/fermentation that enhances good flavors and doesn't introduce bad ones, and all at the sacrifice of yield quantity. 

Fortunately, the recognition these farmers have been receiving has steadily been driving upward, which pushes prices up, and competition for quality in turn as other farmers make their operations more attentive.

### Diving in to the data
Out of nearly 4000 lots showcased at competitions over the last 20 years that made it into the top 30 for auctioning, I've collected them all to see what the data tells us. 
##### Average bid prices have steadily gone up, and farmers feel less pressure to make a bigger sale, opting for quality over quantity

As these coffees are only up for competition within their countries, a curiosity struck me for which country's coffee is best, overall.
